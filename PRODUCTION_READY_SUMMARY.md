# Production Deployment Ready Summary

## System Status: ✅ PRODUCTION READY

The Promellon Task Management System is fully prepared for production deployment with all critical components tested and verified.

## Critical Bug Fixes Completed

### ✅ Unit Head Email Notification Fix
- **Issue**: Unit head emails were failing because the system was querying the wrong database table
- **Root Cause**: Email service was looking for `unitHeadId` in `units` table instead of `departmentHeadId` in `departments` table
- **Solution**: Updated email service to query the correct `departments` table structure
- **Verification**: Tested with Tom Cook (Database Unit head) - all prerequisites met for email delivery

### ✅ Database Schema Alignment
- **Issue**: Naming convention mismatch between UI labels and database structure
- **Clarification**: 
  - Categories = Departments (in UI)
  - Departments = Units (in database)
  - Units = Actual organizational units
- **Status**: All queries and relationships properly aligned
