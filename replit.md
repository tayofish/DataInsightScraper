## Data Flow

### Request Processing
1. Client requests hit Express middleware stack
2. Authentication middleware validates sessions
3. Route handlers process business logic
4. Database operations via Drizzle ORM
5. WebSocket broadcasts for real-time updates
6. Response formatting and error handling

### WebSocket Communication
1. Client connects to `/ws` endpoint
2. Server maintains connection registry with user mapping
3. Real-time events broadcast to relevant connected clients
4. Fallback handling for offline scenarios

### Email Workflow
1. Trigger events (task assignments, mentions, daily summaries)
2. Template rendering with user-specific data
3. SMTP delivery via configured email service
4. Delivery status tracking and retry logic

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 12+ with connection pooling
- **Email Service**: SMTP server (Zeptomail, SendGrid, or custom)
- **File Storage**: Local filesystem with configurable upload directory
- **WebSocket**: Built-in WebSocket server with nginx proxy support

### Production Infrastructure
- **Reverse Proxy**: Nginx with WebSocket upgrade support
- **Process Manager**: PM2 for application clustering and monitoring
- **Session Store**: PostgreSQL-backed session management
- **SSL/TLS**: HTTPS certificate handling via nginx

## Deployment Strategy

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Vite dev server with hot reload
- **Production**: Static file serving with optimized builds
- **Database**: Connection string-based configuration
- **Secrets**: Environment variable management for sensitive data

### Production Deployment
1. **Database Migration**: Execute `production_deployment_schema.sql`
2. **Application Build**: `npm run build` for optimized frontend
3. **Process Management**: PM2 configuration with clustering
4. **Nginx Configuration**: WebSocket proxy and static file serving
5. **SSL Setup**: Certificate installation and HTTPS redirection

### Monitoring and Maintenance
- **Health Checks**: `/api/health` endpoint for system status
- **Database Monitoring**: Connection pool and query performance tracking
- **Email Service**: SMTP configuration validation and delivery monitoring
- **File Management**: Upload directory monitoring and cleanup
